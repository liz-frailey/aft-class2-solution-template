Cracks in the sidewall and tire bulges and blisters can be signs as well. \n\nHow to Check your Tire Tread Depth:  \n\n\t•    The Penny Test is an easy way to measure! Take a penny and place it between the tire tread blocks with Lincoln’s head upside down and facing you. IF the top of his head is visible, you need new tires. \u2028\n\t•\tYou can check your tread depth using a depth gauge. \n\t•\tIt is important to remember to check the depth in different place on different tires as other factors can cause your tires to wear.",
